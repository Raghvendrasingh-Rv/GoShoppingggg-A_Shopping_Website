# Shopping Website

## This is a Shopping website uses **Springboot** for backend and **ReactJs** for frontend.

- To start backend, clone this repo, use any workspace and start the spring application. I have used workspace STS.
- To start clone the [GoShoppingggg-Frontend](https://github.com/Raghvendrasingh-Rv/GoShoppingggg-Frontend) and run `npm start`.
